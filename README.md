# country_detector
detect countries' names in the text (python)


This code is able to compare every single word with a dictionary of countries and return the Alpha-3 code of every country exists in the text.
the initial dictionary is from https://github.com/flyingcircusio/pycountry, but I modified it for some countries with several common names.
